/**
 * Pure wait-loop for the request/reply ("native-request-reply") flow.
 *
 * Design B (locked with CODEX-VOLT):
 * - The outbox stays the source of truth: sending happens elsewhere, this only WAITS.
 * - Store polling is the durable fallback and ALWAYS runs, so a reply is found even
 *   when no live wake signal is available (NATS down / `onSignal` omitted).
 * - An optional `onSignal` source (a read-only NATS tap on the agent's own subject)
 *   accelerates the wait: when a matching envelope arrives we re-check the store
 *   immediately instead of waiting out the poll interval. The signal NEVER carries
 *   the reply itself — decryption + persistence stay the daemon's job — it only nudges
 *   us to re-poll the store the daemon writes into.
 *
 * Lost-wakeup safety: the wake promise is armed BEFORE each store check, so a signal
 * that fires between the check and the race still short-circuits the wait.
