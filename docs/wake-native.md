# Native Wake-On-Message (tmux-Free, OpenClaw-Free)

Murmur wakes agents on new messages using each CLI's **native** mechanism: no
`tmux send-keys`, no OpenClaw bridge, no polling daemon. Human notification stays
on the Telegram bot (`notify_queue`).

## Durable Dispatch Guarantee

The daemon records one wake dispatch per `(msgId, recipientId, memberSlot)` in
SQLite before attempting an active runtime handoff. Claiming or deferring work does
not consume the delivery-attempt budget; an attempt begins only immediately before
the configured hook or native injector is called. Runtime failures use bounded
backoff and become an operator-visible `terminal` dispatch after the configured
attempt limit. A final audit `deny` is recorded as `rejected`, while approval
pending, lease contention, and loop-breaker suppression remain `deferred`.

`handed_off` means only that Murmur completed its current runtime boundary: either
the active hook/injector returned successfully, or a pull-based stateless agent's
message is durable in its local inbox. It does **not** mean the model processed the
message or completed a turn. Runtime processing is tracked separately where the
runtime can provide trustworthy lifecycle events; see
[`processing-receipts.md`](processing-receipts.md).

Dispatch deduplication prevents the same `msgId` from being handed to the same
recipient/member slot twice after a durably recorded `handed_off`. The guarantee is
otherwise **at least once**. A durable `completed` processing receipt suppresses a
replay if the daemon crashes before `handed_off` is persisted. Without that receipt,
or for runtimes that cannot report completion, restart recovery still retries and
the runtime may see the message again.

A `deferred` dispatch is retained for an unlimited time and does not consume the
runtime-attempt budget. This is intentional safe retention for lease contention,
approval waits, and temporary suppression. Stalled-defer observability and an
optional expiry policy are deferred to Iteration 2.

## Claude Code - `asyncRewake` Hook

`scripts/wake-drain-claude.sh` reads new inbound messages from the daemon's
SQLite store (`local_messages`). Run as a Claude Code hook with
`asyncRewake: true`: a non-empty result prints to stderr and exits `2`, and
Claude Code wraps the output in a `<system-reminder>` and wakes the idle session.
A cursor file (`MURMUR_WAKE_CURSOR`) makes each message wake exactly once.

Register it out-of-the-box in the agent's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/scripts/wake-drain-claude.sh", "asyncRewake": true }] }],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/scripts/wake-drain-claude.sh", "asyncRewake": true }] }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/scripts/wake-drain-claude.sh", "asyncRewake": true }] }]
  }
}
```

Env:

- `MURMUR_DB`: daemon SQLite store path (default `.data/murmur.db`, relative to the
  working directory — set it explicitly when the hook runs from elsewhere).
- `MURMUR_WAKE_CURSOR`: cursor file. Defaults to one file **per session**,
  `~/.murmur-wake-cursor-<session>`.
- `MURMUR_WAKE_SESSION_KEY`: overrides the session key (first 8 chars of
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` otherwise).

Drain semantics:

- Only `local_messages.direction='inbound'` rows are surfaced.
- One cursor per session, so a message wakes **every** live session rather than only
  whichever one reached the hook first. Within a session the hook and the cold-idle
  watcher share the key, so it still wakes exactly once.
- The first run in a new session seeds the cursor to the current tip and stays silent:
  without that, a fresh session would replay the whole inbound history as "new".
- The cursor advances to the last **reported** `rowid`, never to the table's tip: a row
  inserted mid-drain would otherwise be stepped over and never wake anyone.
- Cursor writes use a temporary file plus rename where the filesystem allows it.

### Windows / no `sqlite3` CLI — `wake-drain-claude.mjs`

`wake-drain-claude.sh` shells out to the `sqlite3` CLI, which is not installed
by default on Windows (the daemon uses `node:sqlite`, not the CLI). There the
query returns empty, the hook exits `0`, and the session is never woken — native
wake silently looks broken.

`scripts/wake-drain-claude.mjs` is a dependency-free node port that reads the
store via `node:sqlite`, so it runs anywhere node does. It also polls (up to
`MURMUR_WAKE_MAX_SECONDS`, single-poller lock) so a message that arrives while
the session is already idle still wakes it, which a one-shot Stop hook cannot.
Run it under `node --no-warnings` and register the same way:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node --no-warnings /path/to/scripts/wake-drain-claude.mjs", "asyncRewake": true }] }]
  }
}
```

Same env and the same per-session cursor as the shell version (`MURMUR_DB`,
`MURMUR_WAKE_CURSOR`, `MURMUR_WAKE_SESSION_KEY`) plus `MURMUR_WAKE_LOCK`,
`MURMUR_WAKE_MAX_SECONDS`, `MURMUR_WAKE_POLL_MS`. Pass `--once` for a single
non-polling check (e.g. a PostToolUse hook). Requires Node with `node:sqlite`
(22.5+).

The Node poller's per-session lock records its owner PID and is created with one
exclusive write. A subsequent invocation keeps a live owner's lock until the finite
`MURMUR_WAKE_MAX_SECONDS + 120` age ceiling, immediately reclaims a dead owner's
lock, and applies the same ceiling to legacy or malformed PID-less locks. Cleanup
removes the lock only while it still records the current poller's PID. The shell hook
is one-shot and has no poller lock.

A fault — no store, an unreadable store, no `node:sqlite` — prints one line to stderr
and exits `0`. Exiting non-zero would wake the session with a false alarm; exiting
silently is the failure this port exists to remove, so it does neither.

## Codex CLI - App-Server WS-over-UDS

Codex is woken over the `codex app-server` WebSocket protocol on a Unix-domain
socket (`--listen unix://...` or managed remote-control socket): the daemon acts
as a WebSocket client, sends the app-server `initialize` handshake, and then
issues `turn/start` on the live thread when a Murmur message arrives. This
replaces the old `codex-murmur-watch` polling path.

Codex runtime facts verified against Codex CLI `0.141.0`:

- `codex app-server --help` is present.
- `--listen unix://PATH` and `--remote unix://PATH` are supported.
- `codex remote-control start --json` is idempotent and returns
  `.daemon.socketPath`.
- `codex app-server generate-ts --experimental` exposes JSON-RPC method
  `turn/start` with `TurnStartParams { threadId, input }`.

Configure a Codex peer as an app-server wake target:

```json
{
  "wake": {
    "peers": {
      "agent-jarvis": {
        "mode": "codex_app_server",
        "socketPath": "/home/codexworker/.codex/app-server.sock",
        "threadId": "thread-id-of-live-codex-session"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The daemon connects with a `ws+unix://SOCKET:/` client URL. It first sends:

```json
{
  "id": "init-1",
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "clientInfo": { "name": "murmur-codex-app-server-wake" },
    "capabilities": { "experimentalApi": true, "requestAttestation": false }
  }
}
```

After the app-server responds, the daemon sends `initialized` and then:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "turn/start",
  "params": {
    "threadId": "...",
    "input": [{ "type": "text", "text": "[MURMUR WAKE]...", "text_elements": [] }]
  }
}
```

If the Unix socket or live `threadId` is absent, wake fails loud in daemon logs
instead of silently falling back to polling.

The previous `persistent` tmux backend has been removed from the wake path.
Native wake modes are `stateless` shell hooks and `codex_app_server`.

### Codex Desktop on Alex's Mac

Alex's Mac uses a LaunchAgent-managed `codex app-server` as a headless wake
target for the Desktop thread. Because that hidden turn cannot safely write the
Murmur SQLite store from its sandbox, the daemon relays the hidden turn's final
answer back through Murmur when `relayFinalToMurmur=true`.

Operational details, paths, verification commands, and the last known good
message IDs are in [`docs/codex-mac-wake-relay.md`](codex-mac-wake-relay.md).

### Codex Autostart Sequence

> **Diagnostic / opt-in only.** This sequence only covers
> app-server-managed Codex sessions launched with `--remote`. It is not a
> community-grade native wake solution: plain `codex` and desktop-launched Codex
> sessions are not covered because Codex app-server instances are isolated per
> client and currently do not talk to each other. Keep issue #25 open for the
> real product goal. The strategic community-grade path is MCP-channel wake:
> MCP custom notification -> active-session user submission through a supported
> `[mcp_servers]` configuration surface.

Autostart belongs in the Codex launcher wrapper, not in the Murmur daemon. The
launcher owns the live TUI process and is the only layer that can know which
session thread was just attached.

1. Start or attach the managed app-server before launching the TUI:

   ```bash
   codex remote-control start --json
   ```

   Parse `.daemon.socketPath` from stdout. Current Codex `0.141.0` returns a
   shape like:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "connected",
     "daemon": {
       "status": "alreadyRunning",
       "socketPath": "/home/codexworker/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Launch the interactive session against that socket:

   ```bash
   codex --remote "unix://${CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCKET}" "$@"
   ```

   For the vault launcher, this belongs in the session startup entrypoint that
   wraps the real Codex process, not in `codexx` if that wrapper is intentionally
   kept as a dumb `cd && exec codex "$@"` launcher.

3. Capture the live `threadId` automatically after the remote session starts.
   Codex writes session JSONL under
   `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`. The first line is a
   `session_meta` event; use `.payload.id` as the app-server `threadId`. The
   same UUID is embedded in the rollout file name, but the JSONL field is the
   stable capture point.

   Launcher implementation sketch:

   ```bash
   session_file="$(ls -t "$CODEX_HOME"/sessions/*/*/*/rollout-*.jsonl | head -n 1)"
   thread_id="$(head -n 1 "$session_file" | jq -r 'select(.type=="session_meta") | .payload.id')"
   ```

   A production launcher should filter by launch timestamp and current `$PWD`
   (`.payload.cwd`) before accepting the file, so parallel Codex sessions do not
   race the capture.

4. Wire the Codex peer in the agent config before daemon restart:

   ```json
   {
     "wake": {
       "peers": {
         "agent-jarvis": {
           "mode": "codex_app_server",
           "socketPath": "/home/codexworker/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock",
           "threadId": "019ee8b4-382a-76c3-a266-16056dc6108b"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   For the Codex worker deployment, the target file is
   `.data-codex-volt/agent-config.json`. Update it atomically: write a temporary
   JSON file, validate it with `jq empty`, then rename over the old config.

5. Restart the Murmur daemon after the config write:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart murmur-daemon
   ```

   If the daemon is run directly instead of systemd, stop the old process and
   start `node scripts/murmur-daemon.mjs` with the same `DATA_DIR` and
   environment. The daemon reads `wake.peers` only at startup.

With those five steps in the launcher, a new Codex session brings up remote
control, captures its own app-server thread, wires Murmur wake routing, and
restarts the daemon without a manual copy/paste step.

## Scoped Channels & Session Affinity

The Codex autostart sequence above documents a real open problem: app-server
instances are **isolated per client**, so a naive wake can fire the wrong
session — or, when an agent has several sessions open, *every* session reacts to
the same message (double-emit) and the daemon spawns a **competing thread**
alongside the one a human is already attending. Native wake alone has no notion
of which session "owns" the conversation.

Scoped Channels closes that gap with a DB-backed **session-ownership lease**. For
an addressed conversation, exactly one session of the addressed agent holds the
lease; only that session emits, and every other session — and the native daemon
wake — stays silent.

**Lease store.** `SessionLeaseStore` lives in its own SQLite file with a separate
WAL from `local_messages` (tables `channel_owner` + `session_presence`):

- `claim_or_skip` — atomic single-statement compare-and-swap
  (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT(conversation_id, member_slot) DO UPDATE … WHERE stale OR
  same_session`, `token = token + 1 RETURNING token`). The caller that gets a
  token owns the channel; everyone else skips.
- `heartbeat` — keeps a held lease alive without bumping the token.
- `isCurrentToken` — a per-turn fencing token, re-checked at outbound, so a
  resurrected/raced session can't emit under a stale claim.
- `registerSession` / `hasLiveInteractiveSession` — the presence registry the
  wake gate consults.
- `preemptPrefix` (optional) — lets a real interactive chat session reclaim a
  channel from a fallback owner.

**Wake becomes a presence-deferring, lease-gated fallback.** `createNativeLeaseGate`
is injected into `WakeMonitor` as `leaseGate`. Before waking, the daemon checks
session presence:

- a **live interactive session** exists for the agent → the daemon wake
  **defers** (it does *not* spawn a competing thread; the attended session
  handles the message);
- **no** live session → the daemon claims the lease and performs the **cold-wake**
  fallback, exactly as native wake does today.

**One claim across every delivery path.** Foreground-push, cold-start, and
in-session MCP-channel delivery all follow the same rule: claim before any
side-effect, fence the outbound by the lease token, suppress non-owners. The
result is live-verified — N delivery sessions for one message resolve to
**exactly one emit**, and the native daemon wake defers to the attended session
instead of spawning a new thread.

**Compatibility.** The whole feature sits behind `MURMUR_SCOPED_CHANNELS`
(default **OFF**). With no lease gate set, `WakeMonitor` behaves exactly as
described in the sections above — scoped channels is purely additive.

## Why not tmux / OpenClaw

- **tmux send-keys** is fragile (races with human typing; `TIOCSTI` disabled on
  Linux 6.2+) and this environment does not use tmux.
- **OpenClaw** as a wake/delivery dependency is non-standard and a community
  minus; native hooks + app-server + Telegram are standard and dependency-free.

Prior art: `ExaDev/agent-comms`, `cocodrino/bridge-harness` (asyncRewake + NATS),
`synadia-ai` NATS Agent Protocol.
