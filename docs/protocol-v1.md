# Protocol v1

Murmur V2's wire protocol, `schemaVersion` **1.0**. The canonical machine-readable
contract is [`packages/core/schema/protocol-v1.schema.json`](../packages/core/schema/protocol-v1.schema.json)
(JSON Schema, Draft 2020-12); the `@murmurv2/core` runtime guards mirror it, and the
[conformance suite](../packages/core/test/conformance.test.mjs) asserts the schema and
the guards cannot drift. Versioning and forward-compatibility rules live in
[`protocol-compatibility.md`](protocol-compatibility.md).

## Wire types

| Type | Purpose | Schema `$def` | Runtime guard |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `EnvelopeV1` | encrypted inbound message | document root (`#/$defs/EnvelopeV1`) | `isEnvelopeV1` |
| `AckV1` | legacy unsigned delivery acknowledgement | `#/$defs/AckV1` | — |
| `SignedAckV1` | signed, peer/message-bound delivery acknowledgement | `#/$defs/SignedAckV1` | `isSignedAckV1` |
| `PresenceFrameV1` | discovery announcement (public metadata) | `#/$defs/PresenceFrameV1` | `isPresenceFrameV1` |
| `SignedPresenceFrameV1` | Ed25519-signed presence | `#/$defs/SignedPresenceFrameV1` | `isSignedPresenceFrameV1` |
| `StreamStart` / `StreamChunk` / `StreamEnd` | chunked payload streaming | `#/$defs/Stream*` (+ `StreamFrame` union) | `isStreamStart` / `isStreamChunk` / `isStreamEnd` / `isStreamFrame` |

Envelope message payloads are encrypted on the wire; presence frames are intentionally
**public, signed cleartext** metadata (no secret). In all cases the schema validates
**shape**, while signature verification and payload decryption are runtime concerns
(`@murmurv2/security`).

Message identity and grouping are distinct: `msgId` identifies one message,
`conversationId` groups a logical thread, and optional `replyToMessageId` points to
the exact message being answered. Request/reply matching uses `replyToMessageId` and
the expected responder, never conversation or arrival-time heuristics.

## Envelope lifecycle
1. Producer builds `EnvelopeV1`
2. Producer signs envelope and encrypts payload
3. Publish to subject `msg.<conversationId>`
4. Consumer validates schema+signature
5. Consumer processes idempotently using `msgId`
6. Consumer emits a signed ACK or NACK bound to the message digest, conversation, sender,
   recipient, timestamp, and nonce.
7. Sender verifies the signature against the expected peer key and applies an atomic transition
   only while the outbox row is in flight. Replays and mismatched bindings are rejected.
8. Retry policy moves failed messages; terminal failures go to DLQ.

### Signed ACK migration

The daemon emits `SignedAckV1` by default. During a rolling upgrade,
`ackSecurity.requireSigned` (or `MURMUR_REQUIRE_SIGNED_ACKS=1`) remains disabled until every peer
emits signed ACKs; old consumers ignore the additional signed fields. Once peers are upgraded,
enable strict mode on every endpoint. Strict correlation rejects legacy ACKs, stale/future
timestamps, wrong peers, wrong conversations or recipients, digest mismatches, invalid signatures,
and repeated/non-in-flight transitions. Rejections increment reason-tagged counters and emit
metadata-only security events; ACK bodies and message contents are never logged.

An optional `authToken` (bearer `MURMUR-AUTH:…`) authorizes the sender. When present it
is part of the signed payload (cannot be stripped/swapped) and can be verified with
`@murmurv2/federation` `verifyAuthToken`; ingress enforcement (an `authorizeInbound`
helper gated by `MURMUR_ENFORCE_AUTH`) is forthcoming in auth/authz #47 PR-D. Absent on
un-authenticated envelopes, which sign byte-identically to before the field existed —
see [`protocol-compatibility.md`](protocol-compatibility.md).

## Delivery model
- at-least-once delivery
- idempotent consumers mandatory
- per-conversation sequence ordering target

## Discovery (presence)

Discovery never confers trust automatically — a presence frame proves only message
integrity, never that an `agentId` is who it claims. Trust is established out of band
by a deliberate operator promotion.

1. An agent announces a `PresenceFrameV1` — public keys, `subject`, `capabilities`,
   `ttlMs`, ISO-8601 `ts`, and a per-announcement `nonce` — on a discovery subject.
2. Announcements are wrapped as a `SignedPresenceFrameV1` (Ed25519 signature over the
   canonical frame). A listener verifies the signature against the key the frame
   advertises before folding it in (`announcePresence` / `subscribePresence` on the
   NATS broker; verification injected from `@murmurv2/security`).
3. Observers collect frames into a `CandidateRegistry` as **untrusted**
   `DiscoveryCandidate`s — deduped by (`agentId`, `nonce`), expiring at `ts + ttlMs`.
4. An operator (or an approved policy) introspects the roster with `queryCandidates`
   and explicitly promotes one with `promoteCandidate`, which returns the nested
   peer-config entry to wire into `peers[agentId]`. Promotion does not mutate the
   registry; the candidate stays untrusted until the operator applies the entry.

## Streaming

Large payloads are sent as an ordered sequence of stream frames sharing a `streamId`.

1. Producer opens with `StreamStart` — declared `chunkCount` and `totalBytes`
   (optional `contentType`, `startedAt`).
2. Producer emits ordered `StreamChunk`s — `chunkIndex`, **non-empty** `data`, an
   optional per-chunk `sha256`, and `isLast`. (A zero-byte chunk is rejected:
   `stream-chunk-data-required`.)
3. Producer closes with `StreamEnd` — optional whole-stream `digest` / `sha256`
   integrity tags.
4. Receiver reassembles idempotently by `streamId` (in-memory or SQLite-durable):
   duplicate chunks are no-ops, conflicting re-sends are rejected, integrity tags are
   verified, and completion yields the reassembled payload. Backpressure bounds the
   in-flight chunk and byte windows.

- Murmur message -> EnvelopeV1
- OpenClaw session event -> EnvelopeV1
- Human channel events (Telegram etc.) -> EnvelopeV1
