# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Quota-aware agent routing

- One routing availability model (`available | degraded | exhausted | unknown`) from authoritative provider
  usage and positively identified quota errors; only `exhausted` refuses NEW work. `murmur usage --json`
  carries `availability` + `routing`; new `murmur availability <project>`. See `docs/usage-observability.md`.
- Handoffs to an exhausted provider are refused before any durable row/runtime/model, wait durably
  (`provider_waits`) and release exactly once after recovery; dispatches wait in `wake_dispatch` without
  retry storms. No substitution, no coordinator failover, no weakening of mandatory reviewers.
- Menu Bar: exhausted/degraded/unknown rendering, waiting-for-provider tasks, send block for an exhausted coordinator.

### Channel durability and lifecycle

- `murmur_send` / `murmur_request`: `status: "queued"` now means `durable: true` — the outbox
  row is committed and read back before it is claimed; failures are errors. Receipts name the
  profile, project, sender, recipient and conversation (no secrets).
- Explicit routing: optional `projectId`, `profile-mismatch` for the wrong project or a legacy
  profile, `MURMUR_REQUIRE_PROJECT_PROFILE`.
- MCP servers exit with their session; the channel server also exits when its owner is gone.
- `murmur channels [--cleanup]` and a `channel-servers` doctor line (evidence-based; age is
  never a reason to kill).
- `murmur status`: `Dispatches` splits `active` from `unretired`; stale claimed/dispatched rows
  are no longer shown as active. See docs/channel-lifecycle.md.

### Pending
- **NATS transport security (TLS + per-peer auth)** — reviewed and CI-green in #103, held for a coordinated broker/peer credential cutover. It intentionally makes existing non-loopback `nats://` configurations fail closed, so it ships with a maintenance window, not as a routine merge. Two gaps to close first: the Kubernetes ACL example does not cover JetStream subjects (`$JS.API.*`, `$JS.ACK.*`, `_INBOX.*`), and the dashboard's NATS client supports a token only, no user/password or CA.
- **Turning on `ackSecurity.requireSigned`** — a rollout step, not a code step. Until every peer runs 2.5.0+ and the flag is set, unsigned ACKs are still accepted.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-28

> Delivery correctness, found by running the mesh where it had not been run before. A
> cross-host test between a Mac and a Windows box by
> [@lichtpfad](https://github.com/lichtpfad) surfaced three defects that our own hosts
> could not: two of them made a message vanish or repeat forever without a single error
> line, and the third stopped the install outright.

### Fixed

- **A `failed` outbox row could never finish its retry** (#113, #117) — `failed` was listed in `TERMINAL_OUTBOX_STATUSES`, but `claimDue()` selects `failed` on purpose. The retry was re-claimed, published successfully, and then `markSent()` refused it: the status stayed `failed`, `attempts` never grew (so `maxAttempts`/DLQ never fired), `nextAttemptAt` stayed in the past, and the row was re-claimed again on every flush. The returning ACK bounced as `message-not-in-flight`. Nothing short of a manual `dlq` could settle it — 766 log lines over two `msgId`s in the report. The race that v2.6.0 was guarding (a fast ACK/NACK landing between `publish()` and `markSent()`) is now handled per row: `claimDue()` hands out the row `version`, the flush loop passes it to `markSent(msgId, expectedVersion)`, and the update applies only while the row is untouched. That covers any concurrent transition rather than a hand-maintained list of statuses.
- **`murmur_inbox` reported `count:0` for messages that had been delivered** (#114, #116) — the tool ran `searchMessages(agentId)`, a `LIKE` over text/sender/conversationId, and then filtered by direction. A reply that did not happen to spell out the receiving agent's name matched nothing, so the inbox looked empty while the row sat in `local_messages` and the sender saw the delivery `acked`. Measured across three agents: 4 inbound → 0, 3 → 1, 2 → 0. The store is per-agent, so direction is the whole filter; `SQLiteMessageStore.listInbound()` replaces the search. The worst shape a delivery bug can take for autonomous agents — no error, no retry, both sides confident.
- **Install failed on Windows** (#112) — `writePrivateJson` fsync'd the containing directory, which Windows does not support on a directory handle (`FlushFileBuffers` → `EPERM`), so `murmur-join.mjs` died while generating keys. The file itself is fsync'd a line earlier; the directory sync is a durability nicety and is now skipped on win32. Contributed by [@lichtpfad](https://github.com/lichtpfad).
- **Native wake did nothing on Windows** (#115, #118) — `wake-drain-claude.sh` shells out to the `sqlite3` CLI, which a default Windows install does not have (the daemon uses `node:sqlite`, not the CLI). The query came back empty, the hook exited `0`, and the session was never woken: native wake looked broken when a binary was simply missing. `scripts/wake-drain-claude.mjs` is a dependency-free node port that runs anywhere node does, contributed by [@lichtpfad](https://github.com/lichtpfad), plus a poller so a message arriving while the session is already idle still wakes it. The follow-up gave it the per-session cursor from #111, bound the cursor to the last row actually reported (advancing to `MAX(rowid)` could step over a row inserted mid-drain), and made faults report themselves instead of exiting `0` in silence.
- **One inbound message woke only one session** (#111) — the wake cursor and the watcher lock were shared per host, so whichever session reached the hook first advanced the cursor past the message and every other live session, including the one holding the conversation, stayed asleep. Measured over 23–26.08: of 24 sessions that armed a watcher, exactly one was ever on duty. Both are keyed per session now, and a session's first run seeds the cursor to the current tip instead of replaying the whole history.

### Changed

- `MURMUR_DB` defaults to `.data/murmur.db` — the same path `SQLiteMessageStore` uses — in the wake drains and the cold-idle watcher, instead of an absolute path inside one machine's home. `scripts/murmur-to-acp-producer.sh` resolves its Python entry point relative to the repo for the same reason. Set `MURMUR_DB` explicitly when a hook runs from another working directory.
- `OutboxStore.markSent()` takes an optional second argument, `expectedVersion`. Existing callers keep working; anything on the claim → publish → mark path should pass `record.version`.

### Published
- **npm** — `@murmurv2/core` **0.6.0**, `@murmurv2/broker-nats` **0.3.2**, `@murmurv2/broker-ws` **0.2.1**, `@murmurv2/mcp-server` **0.2.1**.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-20

> Closes the four gaps that v2.5.0's compatible signed-ACK path left open. Found by diffing
> #100 against @fedoseevstanislav's strict variant in #104 — the compatible PR looked complete
> on its own, and only the comparison exposed what it did not cover.

### Security

- **Replay protection survives a restart** (#109, #110) — `AckReceiptStore` in `@murmurv2/core` plus an `ack_receipts` table in `SQLiteDedupeOutboxStore` provide claim-once semantics on `(sender_agent_id, nonce)`. Previously nonces lived in a bounded in-memory `Set`: a restart forgot them, so a signed NACK could be replayed against a fresh process — the retry returned the row to `sent` and the replayed NACK failed it again. The in-memory store remains as an explicit fallback, and the daemon now logs a warning when that fallback is what is running rather than implying protection it does not have.
- **The fast-ACK race no longer causes a spurious retry** — `applyAckTransition` accepts `pending` alongside `sent`, so an ACK arriving between `publish()` and `markSent()` is applied instead of rejected as `message-not-in-flight`. `markSent()` now refuses to downgrade a terminal status, so the late call cannot resurrect a settled row.
- **The A2A bridge no longer honours an unsigned NACK** — it resolved a pending task from a bare `{msgId, status: "nack"}` object, letting anyone able to publish to the ACK subject settle someone else's in-flight task with an arbitrary failure string. A verified `SignedAckV1` is now required; `signingPublicKeys` was added to `BridgeA2AConfig`.
- **The WebSocket ACK path is verified like the NATS one** — `processAckFrame` verified nothing and called `markAcked`/`markFailed` straight from the frame. It now checks record lookup, digest, conversation, recipient, known peer, ack-subject binding, signature and nonce claim, with unsigned frames accepted only while `requireSignedAcks` is off.

### Fixed

- **Five packages were built and tested against a stale core.** `bridge-a2a`, `bridge-openclaw`, `bridge-telegram`, `broker-ws` and `federation-nats` declared `@murmurv2/core: ^0.2.0`. Once core reached 0.4.0 npm could no longer satisfy that from the workspace and silently installed 0.2.0 from the registry — their passing tests were passing against code two minor versions behind.

### Published
- **npm** — `@murmurv2/core` **0.5.0**, `@murmurv2/broker-ws` **0.2.0**, `@murmurv2/bridge-a2a` **0.2.0**, `@murmurv2/broker-nats` **0.3.1**.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-20

> First release built substantially from **external contributions**. The security series came from an
> independent audit by [@fedoseevstanislav](https://github.com/fedoseevstanislav); the wake fixes and the
> delivery-semantics analysis came from [@alexanderyswork](https://github.com/alexanderyswork).

### Security

- **Signed and bound delivery acknowledgements** (#100) — ACK correlation previously trusted attacker-controlled JSON carrying only `{msgId, status}`: anyone able to publish to an ACK subject could mark an arbitrary pending outbox row `acked` or `failed`, suppressing delivery or forcing retries without authenticating as the consumer. ACKs are now a versioned `SignedAckV1` with an Ed25519 signature over the message digest, conversation, ACK sender, intended recipient, status, timestamp and nonce; wrong-message, wrong-conversation, wrong-recipient, wrong-peer, stale/future, invalid-signature and replayed ACKs are rejected, and ACK/NACK state changes apply atomically only from the `sent` state. Invalid attempts are metered by bounded reason as metadata-only security events — raw ACK and message bodies are never logged. **Migration is deliberately two-stage:** upgraded daemons emit signed ACKs that legacy peers still parse; strict rejection is opt-in behind `ackSecurity.requireSigned` / `MURMUR_REQUIRE_SIGNED_ACKS=1` until every peer is upgraded.
- **Hardened local state handling** (#101) — the daemon now sets umask `0077` before state/database creation, creates state directories `0700`, atomically creates/replaces secret JSON as `0600`, rejects symlinked, non-regular and wrong-owner config paths, reads configs with `O_NOFOLLOW` and re-checks the opened descriptor, and forces SQLite database/WAL/shared-memory files to `0600`. Agent configs hold long-term signing/encryption private keys and NATS credentials, and rewrites could previously return them to `0664`; SQLite files containing decrypted history were commonly `0644`. OpenClaw config setup no longer prints secret-bearing fields. `SECURITY.md` now documents that local message bodies remain plaintext and require a dedicated OS identity plus encrypted storage or an explicit retention policy.
- **Dashboard rendering and ingress** (#102) — the optional dashboard renders every untrusted field through DOM `textContent` (no `innerHTML`, inline scripts or inline handlers), serves a strict CSP plus clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, referrer, opener, resource and cache protections, and requires Basic authentication backed by a private server-local token file for both HTTP and WebSocket access. Live messages are accepted only after envelope-schema, signature, NATS subject/recipient binding, traffic-direction and known-peer verification; the listener stays loopback-only. **Fails closed** unless `DASHBOARD_TOKEN_FILE` exists with at least 32 URL-safe characters and no group/other permission bits.

### Fixed

- **Codex wake seeded threads are usable** (#97) — `thread/start` no longer discards `thread.path`, and new threads carry `peer.cwd` instead of starting at `cwd: null`, which previously produced wrong workspace roots, missing project instructions and wrong permissions.
- **Per-peer `baseInstructions` no longer dropped** (#98) — `normalizeWakeConfig` carries the value through, making the injector's `peer.resume === false` opt-out reachable from real configuration for the first time.

### Added
- **Production file-level deploy tooling** — `deploy/production-file-deploy.sh`
  now builds gitignored `dist/` artifacts before copying the live-runtime
  allowlist, includes Phase N core/MCP/channel roster files, and refuses to
  deploy if channel/personality markers are missing. Added
  `deploy/production-channel-roster-ops.sh` plus docs for the non-checkout
  production tree.
- **Phase N / N1 channel roster primitives** — `@murmurv2/core` now exposes `ChannelRosterStore` plus typed `ChannelRecord` / `ChannelMemberRecord` APIs. The roster keeps `channelId` distinct from legacy `conversationId`, stores `channels` / `channel_members` in a dedicated SQLite store, preserves existing message-history APIs, and reserves member-level `personaId`, `model`, `baseInstructionsHash`, and `eligibility` fields for N2 addressing and N3 personality binding.
- **Phase N / N2 addressing policy primitive** — `ChannelRosterStore.evaluateAddressing()` returns a shared reject/append/wake decision for `channelId` + explicit addressee flows: legacy no-channel remains broadcast, non-members are rejected, addressed members wake, and observers append history while staying muted.
- **Phase N / N3 personality binding** — `buildChannelThreadStartBinding()` projects a `ChannelMemberRecord` into Codex app-server `thread/start` overrides (`model`, `personality`, optional `baseInstructions`, and audit metadata). Daemon wiring is opt-in only (`channelRoster.enabled` or `MURMUR_CHANNEL_ROSTER=1`) and leaves legacy wake behavior unchanged by default.
- **Phase N / N6 MCP roster surface** — `@murmurv2/mcp-server` exposes `channel_create`, `channel_list`, `channel_members`, and `channel_evaluate_addressing`, backed by `MURMUR_CHANNEL_ROSTER_PATH` (default `DATA_DIR/channel-roster.db`) so agents and UI can manage rosters without direct SQLite access.

### Known gaps
- **Auth enforcement end-to-end** — the broker ingress hook + `authorizeInbound` exist; the daemon does not yet wire them (so `MURMUR_ENFORCE_AUTH` is not enforced end-to-end). Requires daemon roster/identity wiring + token provisioning.
- **Delivery semantics** — failed wakes still advance the cursor and the relay is not idempotent (#105); an empty `finalText` still logs as relayed (#106); `WakeMonitor.drain` is sequential (#107); `threadId` is process-memory only and scoped per peer (#108). All four reported by @alexanderyswork in #96.

### Published
- **npm** — `@murmurv2/core` @ **`0.4.0`** (adds the signed-ACK primitive and the `SignedAckV1` protocol schema). `@murmurv2/broker-nats` @ `0.3.0` (signed-ACK emission and verification at the transport boundary), `@murmurv2/mcp-server` @ `0.2.0` (channel roster surface). `@murmurv2/federation` @ `0.2.0`; `bridge-murmur` @ `0.1.1`; `observability` @ `0.1.2`; `security` @ `0.1.1`; all other `@murmurv2/*` @ `0.1.0`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-23

> Retroactively written on 2026-08-20. The v2.4.0 tag and GitHub release shipped on 2026-06-23 pointing
> at "See CHANGELOG.md for details", but the section was never added — the release notes lived only on
> the tag. Reconstructed here from the release body and the #77 epic record.

### Added

- **DB-backed session-ownership lease.** For an addressed conversation, only the owning session of the addressed agent responds; every other session and agent stays silent. Fixes multi-session double-emit and native wake hitting or spawning the wrong session.
- **`SessionLeaseStore`** — atomic CAS `claim_or_skip`, heartbeat, per-turn fencing token, `session_presence` registry, `preemptPrefix`. Published in `@murmurv2/core@0.3.0`.
- **Presence-deferring native wake** — `createNativeLeaseGate` defers to a live interactive session and claims only as a cold fallback, behind `MURMUR_SCOPED_CHANNELS` (default OFF, backwards compatible).
- **All delivery paths honour one claim** — MCP channel, foreground push and coldstart each claim, fence and suppress against the same contract.

### Validated

- Lease smoke 11/11, wake-lease 7/7, cross-path coordination 9/9, real multi-process race N→1, wake-monitor regression green. Live: N sessions → exactly one emit, native defer with no competing thread.
- External review by the Stas team: approved, no blockers; two minor notes closed (token-monotonicity fence invariant, reserved `native:` preempt namespace).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Agent discovery — complete.** Presence frames + candidate registry (ttl expiry, dedupe, out-of-order guard); signed presence with NATS `announcePresence`/`subscribePresence`; operator promote-flow (`queryCandidates` + `promoteCandidate`) returning the live nested peer-config entry. Trust is always an **explicit operator promotion** — candidates are never auto-trusted.
- **Message streaming — complete.** Stream frames (`stream.start`/`chunk`/`end`), UTF-8-safe chunking, in-memory + durable SQLite reassembly (out-of-order, idempotent, conflict-reject), backpressure (chunk + byte windows), sha256 per-chunk/whole-stream integrity, and an ACK-window.
- **Auth/authz enforcement mechanism** — `signAuthToken`/`verifyAuthToken` now carry a signed **`subject`** (actor); `EnvelopeV1` gains an optional, signed **`authToken`** (bearer `MURMUR-AUTH:…`, appended to the canonical payload only when present → byte-identical back-compat when absent); `@murmurv2/federation` `authorizeInbound` verifies it and binds `subject === senderAgentId`; `@murmurv2/broker-nats` enforces at ingress via an injected `InboundAuthorizer` hook behind `MURMUR_ENFORCE_AUTH` (default OFF, NACK `auth-rejected:<reason>`, never delivered). *Daemon end-to-end wiring pending (see Unreleased).*
- **Conformance suite — extended to every wire type.** `PresenceFrameV1`, `SignedPresenceFrameV1`, `StreamStart`/`StreamChunk`/`StreamEnd` (+ a discriminated `StreamFrame` `oneOf`) added to `protocol-v1.schema.json` and to schema↔runtime-guard agreement matrices; new structural guards `isStreamStart`/`isStreamChunk`/`isStreamEnd`/`isStreamFrame`.
- **Versioned protocol spec.** `docs/protocol-v1.md` (prose lifecycle for envelope, discovery, streaming) + `docs/protocol-compatibility.md` (field tables + per-type validation entrypoints + runtime-only-checks boundary) covering all wire types.

### Changed

- **`stableEnvelopePayload` centralized** into `@murmurv2/core` as the single canonical signing form (was byte-identically copy-pasted across 7 sites: mcp-server, daemon, bridge-a2a, shell-send, demos, agent-runner example, federation live test). Golden-locked by test.

### Fixed

- De-flaked the `mcp-request-reply` C2 long-poll-timeout test (real-timer boundary race → injectable fake clock).

### Validated

- **Real cross-host A2A.** A fresh Murmur agent deployed on Phoenix/agent-hq over the **published** `@murmurv2/*` packages connected to the live broker over Tailscale and exchanged **bidirectional** encrypt/verify/ACK messages with JARVIS — exercising the mesh across real hosts and network (closes the "real mesh deploy" mechanism gate; a second real partner *org* for federation remains an external gate).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Published on npm.** All `@murmurv2/*` packages are public on the npm registry @ `0.1.0` (MIT), under the `murmurv2` org. Publish tooling: `scripts/prep-publish.mjs` (private→public, license, `publishConfig`, intra-workspace `file:`→`^0.1.0`, per-package `prepack` build guard, `files: dist/src + LICENSE`) and `scripts/publish-all.mjs` (root build → topological order → per-tarball assertion that `dist/src/index.{js,d.ts}` exist → publish). `@murmurv2/broker-ws` ships in the next release.
- **WebSocket transport adapter** — `@murmurv2/broker-ws`: relay server + broker client with envelope delivery, ACK correlation, dedupe, and invalid-envelope NACKs, reusing the core primitives. Browser/edge deployment examples pending.
- **Roster-backed auth tokens** — `@murmurv2/federation`: `signAuthToken`/`verifyAuthToken` issue Ed25519-signed tokens with audience, scopes, and `nbf`/`exp` windows; the issuer verify key is resolved from the verified roster (no embedded trust root).
- **`RosterStore`** — `@murmurv2/federation`: pinned-key trust + monotonic-version replay guard (rejects stale/downgraded rosters) + trust-epoch reset on key rotation.
- **Machine-readable protocol schema + conformance** — `@murmurv2/core/schema/protocol-v1.schema.json` (Draft 2020-12; root validates `EnvelopeV1`, `#/$defs/AckV1` for acks) + `docs/protocol-compatibility.md` matrix; the conformance suite asserts the schema and `isEnvelopeV1` agree on every accept/reject.
- **Federation live interop (in isolation)** — cross-org sealed+signed delivery proven over real NATS accounts and a leaf-node topology with least-privilege publish/subscribe boundaries (`packages/federation-nats/integration/`); a NATS accounts-config renderer generates each org's account contract.
- **ACP autonomy loop** — idempotent Murmur→ACP task producer + a gated send-boundary worker client.

### Changed

- README, file tree, and Roadmap synced to the real state, with honest scoping for in-isolation / mock-counterpart features.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **JetStream durability (opt-in).** Optional NATS JetStream durable consumers behind the existing broker/outbox interface — finite `max_deliver` (default 5) + `ack_wait` (default 30s), automatic repair of drifted consumers, retryable-failure `nak()` for broker redelivery, and poison-message terminal ACK. Default-OFF; enable with `MURMUR_JETSTREAM=1` or `config.jetstream.enabled`. The SQLite outbox remains the transactional source of truth.
- **JetStream advisory → DLQ.** `startJetStreamAdvisoryDlq` routes `MAX_DELIVERIES` / `MSG_TERMINATED` advisories to the outbox dead-letter sink.
- **Federation (cross-org).** New `@murmurv2/federation` — `org/agentId` addressing (bare id ⇒ local org) and an Ed25519-signed per-org key directory (roster) — and `@murmurv2/federation-nats` — NATS leaf-node / per-org account `fed.*` subject contract with subject-safe token encoding and account export/import isolation. Payload stays E2E-opaque across federation.
- **A2A bridge skeleton.** `@murmurv2/bridge-a2a` terminates the industry-standard A2A protocol (`@a2a-js/sdk`) and re-wraps tasks as internal Murmur E2E envelopes.
- **Native wake self-heal.** Codex app-server wake threads are re-seeded automatically when missing/stale; WS-over-UDS transport for the Codex app-server.

### Changed

- Wake/notify runtime no longer routes through OpenClaw or tmux persistent injection; native Claude/Codex wake plus Telegram notify are the supported paths.

### Security

- `verifyRoster` verifies a federation roster against a caller-pinned org key, not the roster's own embedded key — prevents an attacker from publishing a self-signed forged roster.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- `murmur_request` send-and-wait tool for synchronous request/response over NATS.
- Mandatory WakeMonitor with deduplication, loop-breaker, audit-gate, and drain guards.
- WakeMonitor stateless and persistent wake modes.

### Fixed

- ACK routing now targets the original sender, not the consumer.
- Reconnect resilience defaults for long-running NATS clients.

### Changed

- Transport documentation now reflects core NATS plus SQLite outbox behavior without claiming JetStream durability.
- Security bump: `ws` upgraded to 8.21.0.
